### Project Title
Analysis of Bikeshare data

### Description
* The project contains a python file which uses Pandas and SciPy to analyse the bikeshare data for 2017
* The project takes the user's inputs and then produces descriptive statistics of the data based on the date and city entered.
* The project code computes the following statistics:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

    total travel time
    average travel time

#4 User info

    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### Files used
* The project utilises the following csv files to retrieve data; chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv.
* The datasets contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender

### Credits
The data was collected from the Udacity Nanodegree program 'Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program'.
